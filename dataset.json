However, an examination of Bach’s compositional practices reveals that it was customary during his era to adapt or reuse musical material in new compositions. Taking this into consideration, the creators of this recording have drawn on a range of sources to answer the question of how a solo recorder concerto by Bach might have sounded. \n\nThe disc includes four full recorder concertos, based on material taken from existing harpsichord concertos and cantata movements, which Bach himself often reused or transcribed for different instrumentation. It closes with an organ prelude adapted for recorder and strings.The recordings are accompanied by extensive booklet notes, which outline the sources used in the construction of this repertoire and reveal an interesting dimension of Bach’s compositional practice – his approach to reusing and adapting musical material. \n\nThese recordings are brought to life by compelling performances from Erik Bosgraaf and Ensemble Cordevento, performed on a range of recorders and period instruments. Displaying an imaginative yet thorough approach to the repertoire, this disc is a fascinating examination of how Bach might have approached writing largescale works for the recorder and is recommended to any listeners interested in his concertos. \n\n00:00:00 Concerto in G Major, Arias from Cantatas BWV 215 and 32, transcribed by Thiemo Wind: I.

        "description": "Brahms's massive 2nd piano concerto, in four movements rather than the usual three, opens with a marvelous, mood-setting horn call that seems to gather all the other instruments. The piano responding to its graceful melody with equally graceful arpeggios before embarking on a thorny cadenza that announces the virtuoso nature of the movement in no uncertain terms. But it is a virtuosity neither omnipresent nor strained. Whenever one thinks the drama is on the verge of getting out of hand, the composer reintroduces a placating element, the opening horn theme, played either by that instrument or by different sections of the orchestra.\n\nAlthough Brahms labeled the second movement a “tiny, tiny little scherzo,” it is in fact the most dramatic and tempestuous of the four movements, at the outset a crashing, battering workout for the piano, followed and contrasted by a yearning, mellow theme for the violins and a noble trio section, prior to the repetition of the opening histrionics.\n\nThe exquisitely songful, nocturnal slow movement is based entirely on the solo cello’s eight-measure phrase, which is subsequently passed to the violins and then expanded by the piano – a melody to which Brahms would later return for one of his most haunting songs, “Immer leiser wird mein Schlummer” (Ever gentler grows my slumber).\n\nThe initial impression of the rondo finale is one of gracious relaxation, but it is hardly of a single piece or mood, as seen from the increasing brilliance of the solo, the skipping opening theme, and the final orchestral crescendo. By this time the mood has changed from gracious to thunderous, in which vein the concerto ends.\n\n0:00 - Allegro non troppo\n18:45 - Allegro appassionato\n28:14 - Andante\n42:40 - Allegretto grazioso\n\nPerformed with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra\nLeonard Bernstein, conductor",

While it's called a waltz, it's not quite like the traditional waltzes you might think of, but it does have a waltz-like rhythm and melody that makes it captivating.\n\nDmitri Shostakovich (1906-1975) was a prominent Russian composer and pianist of the 20th century. Renowned for his significant contributions to classical music, Shostakovich's compositions span a wide range of genres, including symphonies, chamber music, operas, and film scores. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the Soviet era.\n\nMore Dmitri Shostakovich performances by Abbraccio Classical: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXJkoItMM_p2EiW85WIL0LFDdj52l75C6\n\nAbbraccio Classical is a classical music organization established in 2006 developing a range of high end historic and contemporary productions from small ensembles to full orchestras.\n\nUnder the guidance of Abbraccio Classical founder and leader Francesco DeLeo, Abbraccio Classical has undertaken dozens of original recording productions and hundreds of live performances across Europe, North America, South America, Africa and Pan Asia.\n\nMore classical performances by Abbraccio Classical: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXJkoItMM_p0b_TLOqIDIG0bLgPfhhZ9P\n\nSubscribe to Abbraccio Classical for more classical performances: https://www.youtube.com/@abbraccioclassical\n\n#AbbraccioClassical #Shostakovich #WaltzNo2",
