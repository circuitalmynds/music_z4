CZERNY  Divertissement de Concert op 204 for piano and orchestra

Czerny was perhaps the first musician to achieve turning their musical craft into a successful business, without relinquishing to produce non-commercial works (his "serious" music). Many of Czerny's didactic works for piano, his arrangements and variations of popular opera themes and other concertant and brilliant works for piano were published during his life with very good acceptance. When Czerny died he left a fortune estimated at 400 thousand florins, destined by will to charity (perhaps due to their contact with Beethoven, Czerny benefited an institution for the deaf in his will), his housekeeper and the Society of Friends of Music in Vienna.
