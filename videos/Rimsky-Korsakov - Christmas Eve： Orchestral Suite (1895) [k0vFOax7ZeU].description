A thrilling orchestral suite by Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844-1908), based on music from the 1895 opera of the same name. The plot of the opera follows the short story "Christmas Eve" from Nikolai Gogol's "Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka". The same story also formed the basis of Tchaikovsky's operas "Vakula the Smith" and "Cherevichki".
