Here's another Hawaii song from my collection.  Ray Noble New Mayfair Dance Orchestra. Albert Allick "Al" Bowlly (7 January 1898 -- 17 April 1941) was a popular Jazz guitarist, singer, and crooner in the United Kingdom and later in the United States of America during the 1930s, making more than 1,000 recordings between 1927 and 1941. He was killed by the explosion of a parachute mine outside his flat in Duke's Court, 32 Duke Street, St James, London during the Blitz.
